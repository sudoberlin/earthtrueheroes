Earth Prodigy

...Earth’s True Heroes

Problem Statement:

Humans are the main cause of Climate change. We burn fossil fuels and chop down forests, causing average temperatures to rise worldwide. That global warming trend is increasingly disrupting our climate – the average weather over the years. There are several ways1 in which we can reduce our carbon footprint, like Reducing food waste by planning meals ahead of time, freezing excess leftovers, Switching of lights when leaving the room, unplugging electronic devices when not in use, installing low-flow shower head and so on.

Education is an essential factor^2 in the ever more urgent global fight against climate change. Knowledge regarding this phenomenon helps young people to understand and tackle the consequences of global warming, encourages them to change their behavior and helps them to adapt to what is already a global emergency.

We intend to develop a game/educational app for children (for ages 5-12) that would not only teach them importance of conservation of resources but also develop an instinct that they would hopefully follow throughout their life and become “Earth’s True Heroes”.

Motivation:

For UNESCO^2, education, especially when focused on children and young people, is a key factor in helping to curb climate change. Specifically, it says that "education... encourages changes in young people's attitudes and behavior and helps them to adapt to climate changerelated trends".

App Description:

The app would present several different scenarios to children and ask to choose an action that they would take in those situations. The correct action would receive a positive reinforcement. It would also present facts about climate change, how a small contribution could impact the world on large scale. The app will also consist of an educational component where children would learn about measurement of resources used or saved, along with Q&A. The questions and scenarios of the app will vary according to the age of the child and their progress towards developing a responsible mindset.
